# Part 3: Trust Boundaries in Smart Devices — A Postmortem on the Meross MSL320

After completing both passive and active analysis of the Meross MSL320 smart light strip, I chose to conclude this investigation not with further technical testing, but with a deeper look at what had already been exposed — and what it implies for real-world security.

This device didn’t yield any major exploits. It didn’t have to. What it did reveal was arguably more important: **trust boundaries that were assumed, not enforced**.

## 🧠 Findings Worth Revisiting

### 🔹 1. The Open, Dormant `/config` Endpoint

An HTTP endpoint at `/config` remains active post-pairing. It does not respond to unauthorized requests — but it does accept them.

This endpoint is:
- Not protected by authentication
- Not rate-limited
- Not disabled after setup
- Not officially documented (by Meross)

According to reverse-engineered documentation I found online, this path is used during onboarding to send Wi-Fi credentials — **unencrypted, in base64**, over plaintext HTTP. While modern versions of the Meross app could use a more secure flow, the presence of this **legacy or dormant attack surface** is a clear failure of minimal exposure principles.

### 🔹 2. HomeKit Broadcasts and mDNS Noise

The device persistently advertises itself using mDNS (`_hap._tcp.local`), even after pairing and without any active user interaction. This allows anyone on the local network to:
- Identify the device model
- Confirm it's HomeKit-compatible
- Infer active configuration
- Monitor boot/reboot cycles (via re-announcement behavior)

HomeKit security prevents unauthorized control, but the **visibility of metadata** still provides attackers with a clear footprint of the network.

## 🔍 If I Were Red Teaming This Device

I wouldn’t try to hack it directly. I’d map and fingerprint it:
- Use mDNS to identify every smart device on a shared LAN
- Build a passive profile of reboot cycles, app usage, and response behaviors
- Watch for `/config` or onboarding APIs left open — especially in non-HomeKit scenarios
- Attempt DNS spoofing during pairing (based on documented flaws)
- Try LAN-side downgrade attacks by simulating app behavior with missing or incorrect auth

The device may be quiet, but it **trusts the LAN too much** — and in modern threat models, **LAN ≠ safe**.

## 🧠 Final Reflections

The Meross MSL320 is, on paper, a "secure" device. But like many smart products, its firmware leaves behind traces of legacy thinking — open ports, passive broadcasts, minimal isolation.

And that’s the real takeaway here:

> **Security isn’t just about what a device does when you use it — it’s about what it quietly allows when you don’t.**

This exercise didn’t result in compromise. It resulted in clarity.
